# Decisions Log

Lightweight cross-session memory. Append a short entry per phase / decision.

## 2026-06-30 — Phase 0–3 initial build

- **Scope:** Implemented Phases 0–3 in one pass (scaffold + capture, `/cameras`
  viewer, detection + `/parking`, push loop). Hardware-specific values ship as
  placeholders to fill in on the homeserver.
- **Secrets:** gitignored `.env` (+ committed `.env.example`). Loaded via
  `python-dotenv` locally and `env_file` in Docker. No secrets in `config.yaml`
  or code. Repo is safe to publish.
- **Packaging:** runs in Docker (`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`). ffmpeg is
  installed in the image; `models/` and `config.yaml` are mounted at runtime so
  weights/ROIs are not baked in.
- **Open decisions resolved:**
  - Viewer scope → **live channels (1,2,3) only**, config-driven.
  - Alert policy → **free-only, once per transition**.
  - Camera labels default: 1=Sokak, 2=Giriş, 3=Bahçe (edit in `config.yaml`).

## 2026-06-30 — Models on /mnt/models

- All AI/ML models live on the dedicated **`/mnt/models`** disk (229 GB, ~empty)
  because the root disk is at 97% (3.8 GB free). This matches the existing
  `ollama` and `fastembed-cache` dirs already there.
- `docker-compose.yml` mounts `/mnt/models` → `/app/models` (ro). Non-Docker
  runs use `PARKING_MODEL_PATH=/mnt/models/yolov8n.onnx`.
- `yolov8n.onnx` was exported on-box via a throwaway ultralytics/torch venv
  placed on `/mnt/models` (pip cache + TMPDIR forced there) so the export never
  touched root, then the venv was deleted. `scripts/export_model.py` writes to
  `/mnt/models/yolov8n.onnx` by default (`MODEL_OUT` overrides).

### Still TODO on the homeserver
- [ ] Pin the XVR static IP and set `NVR_IP` in `.env` (plan §9).
- [ ] Capture real ROI polygons via `scripts/grab_frame.py`, paste into
      `config.yaml` (current polygons are placeholders).
- [ ] Night-frame test (plan §9) → Phase 4 tuning (per-time-of-day thresholds).
